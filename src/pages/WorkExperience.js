          During the Covid-19 pandemic, I decided to take a leave from my
          studies at UNSW for one term. Despite having a bachelor's degree in
          mechanical engineering, I had little knowledge of programming. To
          improve my skills, I pursued an internship at QST Corporation, a
          semiconductor company in Shanghai. <br></br>As an assistant in the FAE
          department, my responsibilities included testing the accelerometer
          (QMI8610) and Gyroscope Sensor (QMI8658) for large bias, recording
          data, and using Python to process the data. I also gained experience
          in PCB welding during my time at the company.

          Due to the Covid-19, I decided to applied for a program leave in
          UNSW for one term. Although I got a bachelor's degree in mechanical
          engineering at that time, I know little about the programming. Thus, I
          went on an internship at a semiconductor company.<br></br> I worked as an
          assistant in the FAE department in QST Corporation (Semiconductors,
          Shanghai). I was responsible for testing the accelerometer (QMI8610)
          and Gyroscope Sensor (QMI8658) with large bias, recording the data and
          writing codes with Python to process those data. I also did some PCB welding works.
